# Linux-Scripts

A simple collection of scripts that i use to boost my workflow.

## Usage
Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/zar-hub/Scripts.git
```
To make the scritps executable from anywhere you can add the folder path to “~/.bashrc”. 
You can open up the “.bashrc” file (it is in your Home directory, but is hidden by default) in your favorite text editor, like gedit.

Go to the very end of the file and add:
```bash
export PATH="/path_of/the_folder_we/want_to_add_to:$PATH"
```
